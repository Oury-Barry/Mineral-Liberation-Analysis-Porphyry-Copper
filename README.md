# MLA Mineral Processing Project

This repository hosts the analysis of flotation samples from a porphyry copper ore processing line using Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA).

## Project Summary

- Analyzed four measurement datasets from a flotation mineral processing line.
- Renamed and prepared data files for easier handling.
- Described copper sulfide minerals (chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, covellite), pyrite, molybdenite, and gangue minerals in concentrate and tailings.
- Created grain size distribution curves and histograms for key minerals.
- Applied grain size filtering to define particle classes.
- Performed comparative mineral liberation analysis by particle composition and free surface area on filtered and unfiltered samples.
